## Purpose of Program

I created this spreadsheet to mimic the layout of a 96- well plate for the Baker Research Group, a lab I am an undergraduate research assistant for. This program allows members of the lab to fill out what wells of the plate they put their sample in, which lets others know whose sample is where before sending the plate off for bioassay. 

When coding this program, a challenge I faced was figuring out how to embed the drop-down list into the spreadsheet. I could make the dropdown box outside of the spreadsheet, but not how I wanted it to function. Another challenge I faced was attempting to change the labels of the rows of the spreadsheet to letters instead of numbers. 

Some features I hope to implement in this program is that the user can color code their selection on the spreadsheet and something that allows the user to enter their sample name along with their name.
